# week5
## introduction
This week we'll learn basics of electronics production
## what is elctronics proiduction
Generally speaking, the electronics manufacturing process includes the following aspects, such as PCB manufacturing, PCB assembly, box build assembly, functional testing, quality inspection and packaging. Here are the main processes for Electronics Manufacturing.

## introduction of Roland DGA
We'll use Roland DGA products as a tool in this practice
The MDX-50 benchtop CNC mill combines precise, automated milling and unmatched ease-of-use. An ideal solution for short-runs and prototypes, the MDX-50 reduces operation time and simplifies production so users of all abilities can mill functional parts with incredible quality on a wide range of materials.

## practice
We'll use a board that would house an Arduino XIAO ESP32 as an example for this practice
First, adjust the settings properly, and put the copper board into the machine, it will work automatically, supervision is needed to avoid accidents.
