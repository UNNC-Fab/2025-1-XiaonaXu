## Introduction 
This week we will cover the basics of CAD, we will use auto desk Fusion 360 as an example to teach you how to do so.
## What is CAD
Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computers (or workstations) to aid in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design. This software is used to increase the productivity of the designer, improve the quality of design, improve communications through documentation, and to create a database for manufacturing.Designs made through CAD software help protect products and inventions when used in patent applications. CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for print, machining, or other manufacturing operations. The terms computer-aided drafting (CAD) and computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) are also used (credit to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design))
