## introduction
This week we will cover the basics of electronics design. We'll start from drawing a circuit board using software and manufacture them for later experiments.
## What is Electronics Design?

Electronics design is the process of creating circuits to perform specific functions, such as powering devices, processing signals, or controlling systems. It involves selecting components, calculating values, and arranging them to work together efficiently and safely.

## Tools and Materials

To get started, you’ll need:
- **Breadboard**: For prototyping without soldering.
- **Multimeter**: To measure voltage, current, and resistance.
- **Components**: Resistors, LEDs, capacitors, transistors, etc.
- **Power Supply**: A battery (e.g., 9V) or a bench power supply.
- **Wires**: Jumper wires or solid-core wire for connections.
- **Design Software**: Optional tools like KiCad, Eagle, or Fritzing for schematics.
- **Soldering Kit**: For permanent circuits (optional).

## Basic Concepts

Before designing, understand these key ideas:
- **Voltage (V)**: The electrical potential difference, measured in volts.
- **Current (I)**: The flow of electrons, measured in amperes (amps).
- **Resistance (R)**: Opposition to current flow, measured in ohms (Ω).
- **Ohm’s Law**: `V = I × R` – relates voltage, current, and resistance.
- **Series vs. Parallel**: Components can be connected end-to-end (series) or side-by-side (parallel), affecting total resistance and current flow.
