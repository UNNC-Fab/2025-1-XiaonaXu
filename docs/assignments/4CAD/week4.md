## Introduction 
This week we will cover the basics of CAD, we will use auto desk Fusion 360 as an example to teach you how to do so.
## What is CAD
Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computers (or workstations) to aid in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design. This software is used to increase the productivity of the designer, improve the quality of design, improve communications through documentation, and to create a database for manufacturing.Designs made through CAD software help protect products and inventions when used in patent applications. CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for print, machining, or other manufacturing operations. The terms computer-aided drafting (CAD) and computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) are also used (credit to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design))
## Fusion 360
Autodesk Fusion includes all design and 3D modeling tools, plus a fully featured CAM, CAE, and PCB product development platform.

Comprehensive CAM functionality
Multi-user collaboration and data management
Unified electronics and PCB designs
Phone, email, forum, and in-product support
All import/export file types
Automated drawings and automated modeling
Configurations (CAD, CAM, CAE)
Bill of Materials (BOM)
Cloud rendering
Cloud simulation and advanced machining upgrades

## How to
Here is an actual practice of using Autodesk Fusion for CAD:
First, create sketch

After creating this sketch, use the revolve command to create a 3D shape

now, use the same way, create another object

Our goal is to connect these two, but in a smart way, use Automated modelling command

Select the objects you want to connect, and the specific part desired, and mark the parts you don't want to be connected. After that, you'll generate the shape automatically like this
